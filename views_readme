Jenkins View Builder is a command line tool for managing jenkins views using
simple descriptions in YAML format. You can store your view descriptions in a
version control system to make changes and control them.

Installation
============
Install jenkins-view-builder by running the following command:
  $ sudo pip install jenkins-view-builder


Configuration file
==================
Jenkins View Builder uses configuration file which must contain the following
properties to connect to Jenkins:
 - Jenkins URL
 - Jenkins user
 - Password or token

EXAMPLE:
[jenkins]
user=admin
password=admin
url=http://localhost:8080


Running
=======
In command line you can invoke Jenkins View Builder by running
'jenkins-view-builder'. To get it working you should run this tool in ```test```
or ```update``` mode. In Test mode you must specify path to yaml file(s). In
Update mode you also must specify path to configuration file.


Test Mode
=========
Once you have a defined yaml configuration you can test the view to make sure
that jenkins-view-builder creates the correct xml that can be applied to jenkins.
The following command puts generated xml(s) to the ```out``` folder of the
current working directory:

```$ jenkins-view-builder test /path/to/foo.yaml```

You can also use a wildcard or successively specify paths to yamls instead of one
file name to use multiple definitions at once and specify output directory for
generated xmls:

```$ jenkins-view-builder test /path/to/defs/*.yaml -o /path/to/output```
or
```$ jenkins-view-builder test /path/to/defs/one.yaml /path/to/defs/two.yaml \
     -o /path/to/output```


Update Mode
===========
If generated XML looks good you can apply the view to jenkins using the following
command:

```$ jenkins-view-builder update --conf /path/to/conf /path/to/foo.yaml```

To update a specific set of views, use a wildcard or successively specify paths
to yamls instead of one file name:

```$ jenkins-view-builder update --conf /path/to/conf /path/to/defs/*.yaml```
or
```$ jenkins-view-builder update --conf /path/to/conf /path/to/defs/one.yaml \
     /path/to/defs/two.yaml```

The command creates new views or updates already existing ones logging all the
actions to stdout.


View Definitions
================
Jenkins-view-builder takes yaml-formatted view definitions as input, transforms
them to xml jenkins configs and applies to Jenkins instance, which is set in a
config file.

The example of List view defined in a yaml file:

- view:
    type: list
    name: test-view
    regex: 'Merge-.*'
    description: This view is used as test view.
    jobs:
     - test-job
     - debug-job
    columns:
     - status
     - weather
     - job
     - last_success
     - last_failure
     - last_duration
     - build_button
    recurse: False
