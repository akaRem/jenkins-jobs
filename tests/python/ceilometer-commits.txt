    Add validation for polling_namespaces option
    
    We find that if polling_namespaces is specified by config file
    instead of in command line args, the validation doesn't work at all,
    which cause the agent still running but in a wrong state.
    This patch fixes it.

    Remove gabbi tests that check content-location
    
    The content-location header is an artifact of using httplib2
    and not something that ceilometer itself returns. Gabbi is going
    to stop using httplib2 (and so is much of OpenStack) so to prepare
    for that these tests need to stop testing something that doesn't
    really mean anything.

    better support notification coordination
    
    when launching multiple agents at same time, there is a chance that
    agents will miss the registry of another agent. this is possible
    because there is a lot of overhead involved when starting up agents,
    specifically with initialising managers.
    
    this change makes it so the agent only joins the group AFTER it has
    done all setup that does not require coordination. after it joins,
    we start listening right away for other changes to group membership
    
    additionally, this adds a lock to pipeline queue setup so only one
    event at any time can trigger a reconfiguration.

    Remove transformers from pipeline.yaml
    
    In Liberty we cannot run more then one notification agent in cloud
    without coordination. So, we have several approaches how to
    solve this problem:
    
    1. Run one notification agent under pcs.
       pros: we keep transformers
       cons: one notification agent is not enough for big envs
    
    2. Change config and not to gather "delta" and "util" by default
       pros: ok from performance PoV; no changes in puppet
       cons: transformer-based meters are not generated
    
    We've chosen the second approach. If tranformers will be needed, we can
    deploy our redis plugin, switch on coordination mode and add transformers
    back to config.
    Removed unit tests tested default pipeline.cfg, not the functionality.
    That is why is is safe to remove them.

    Changes aggregator transformer to allow retention_time w/o size
    
    When using an aggregator transformer in pipeline.yaml that
    looks like this:
    ---
    transformers:
        - name: "aggregator"
          parameters:
              retention_time: 60
              resource_metadata: last
    ---
    'size' will automatically be defaulted to 1. That means that
    aggregation will not happen as expected with a retention_time of
    60 seconds.
    
    This fix will only default sample size to 1 if neither
    retention_time or size are defined.

    avoid unnecessary inner join in get_resources() for SQL backend
    
    To get distinct resource ids, we do a query on resource table which
    inner join sample table, and apply filters on it.
    
    Note that when sql_expire_samples_only is enabled, there will be
    some resources without any sample, in such case we must use inner
    join to avoid wrong result, no matter if there is a timestamp filter
    or not.
    
    But that option is disabled by default, so when there is no timestamp
    filters, the inner join is unnecessary, we should avoid it to save
    some RAM/CPU cost.

    avoid using isolation level
    
    depending on sql driver, REPEATABLE READ isolation level may lock
    an entire table and cause write timeouts. isolation level was set
    originally to ensure consistent reads between 2 queries required to
    build events. that said, we can avoid table locks by making
    assumption that the 1st query is the correct base and any difference
    given by 2nd query can be discarded.

    avoid generate temporary table when query samples
    
    Currently, when we call query-samples API, for SQL backend, we do
    an inner join to get a temporary table, then apply filters, orderby
    and limit options on it. Such implementation will drain disk space
    or cause timeout exception when data set is growing, even with specified
    limit and filters.
    
    This patch applies filters and limit on the inner join itself, and
    uses a fake mapper object instead of temporary table to suit current
    query transformer.

    support mysql+pymysql in functional test
    
    Currently, if we use PyMySQL as MySQL driver, database connection
    url will be set to mysql+pymysql://, but our functional test doesn't
    recognize such engine name, which finally will skip all the functional
    test for mysql backend.
    
    This patch simply maps mysql+pymysql to mysql.

    master because master has changed such that there is no longer a
