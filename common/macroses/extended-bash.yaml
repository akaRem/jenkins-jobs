    #
    # Very cool wrapper for bash scripts that exposes some core functionality and
    # could be easily extended without copy-pasting original scripts.
    #
    # So using it you can execute script and inject results to jenkins env easily
    #
    # NOTE: headers should be used for including existing sh files which should contain
    #       only function declaration (and no self-executive code) for easier debugging
    #       and extending.
    #
    #
    # Core things
    #
    #   inject <VAR_NAME> [<VAR_VALUE>]         injects some k-v to into jenkins env
    #                                           DON'T `inject VAR_NAME=VAR_VALUE`

    #         inject MY_VARIABLE 42
